	<h2>What is Fortnite?</h2>
	<p>
		Fortnite is a battle royale game that starts with 100 players 
		and ends with one player who gets the victory royale. Gamers 
		can choose the mode they would like to play in, solo, duo mode 
		or in a squad. They can add friends to their squad and play as 
		a team. The game's animations and graphics are some reasons 
		people play this game. Gamers can help their teammates by 
		joining the voice chat built into the game. 
	</p>
	<h2>Season 1</h2>
	<p>
		Season one was the first Fortnite season.  The games wore 
		free default skins or purchased the new skins from the item
		shop. The season was essential, with no daily challenges giving 
		the players the time to get used to the controls. The item 
		shop needed to be unlocked before you made a purchase.  
	</p>
	<h2>Season 2</h2>
	<p>
		 Season two is when the Battle Pass came into the picture. 
		 Players were beginning to learn more and more about the games 
		 and the beautiful map. The first series of big map changes 
		 included Shifty Shafts, Snobby Shores and Tilted Towers. 
		 Tilted Towers quickly became the most active city in all 
		 of Fortnite. The battle pass was here, which made games 
		 play more to level up. If you hit tier 70 of the Battle 
		 Pass, you unlocked the Black Knight. 
	</p>
	<h2>Season 3</h2>
	<p>
		 Season three was when Fortnite gained the most popularity. 
		 The gameplays improved, and players starting to find new 
		 techinques to enhance their chance to win. Lucky Landing 
		 was introduced to celebrate the Chinese New Year. 
	</p>
	<h2>Season 4</h2>
	<p>
		 This season was superhero-themed. Players had to unlock the 
		 fully upgraded Omega outfit using the challenges in the battle 
		 pass. After Dusty Depot was destroyed, it left behind Dusty 
		 Divot.  The new map locations were added, including Risky Reels. 
		 The Jetpack was added but was removed shortly after. 
		 The Drum Gun was added but later changed to make it less 
		 overpowered. Dual Pistols and Stink Bombs and Stink Bombs 
		 were also added. “Blast Off!” was the name of the end of 
		 season event. 
	</p>
	<h2>Season 5 - Season X</h2>
	<p>
		 From season 5-X we saw more battle pass changes and more 
		 changes to the map. New guns were introduced and old ones were 
		 taking out. The map constantly shifted and more new tequeniques 
		 were prefected. Now, Fortnite is on to the next chapter of the 
		 famous games.
