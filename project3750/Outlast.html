	<p>The game will give you an experience of hell, a first-person 
	survival horror game developed by veterans. You are an investigative 
	journalist Miles Upshur, explore Mount Massive Asylum. The objective
	 is to try to survive long enough to discover its terrible acts 
	 taken place in the asylum. The game starts as you enter the Asylum 
	 and see all the patients with certain parts surgically removed. 
	 You follow the blood and find clues to what happened inside the 
	 Asylum. The character has a camera that can be used to see in the 
	 dark. When things are chasing you, you are allowed to hid in the 
	 barrels. The character gets bruised up along the way, but it is a 
	 great game to ramp up your heart. Outlast was created by Red Barrels.
	 They used Unreal Engine 3, which is a suite of well built tools
	 for game developers to design and build games, and visualizations.</p></div>
